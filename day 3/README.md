## Question 1

### Linear Search with Comparison Count

Problem: Implement linear search to find key k in an array. Count and display the number of comparisons performed.

Input:

- First line: integer n (array size)
- Second line: n space-separated integers
- Third line: integer k (key to search)

Output:

- Line 1: "Found at index i" OR "Not Found"
Line 2: "Comparisons = c"

Example:
Input:
5
10 20 30 40 50
30

Output:
Found at index 2
Comparisons = 3

Explanation: Compared with 10, 20, 30 (found at index 2 with 3 comparisons)
