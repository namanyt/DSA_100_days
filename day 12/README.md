## Question 1

### Check Symmetric Matrix

Problem: Write a program to check whether a given matrix is symmetric. A matrix is said to be symmetric if it is a square matrix and is equal to its transpose (i.e., element at position [i][j] is equal to element at position [j][i] for all valid i and j).

Input:
- First line: two integers m and n representing the number of rows and columns
- Next m lines: n integers each representing the elements of the matrix

Output:
- Print "Symmetric Matrix" if the given matrix is symmetric
- Otherwise, print "Not a Symmetric Matrix"

Example:
Input:
3 3
1 2 3
2 4 5
3 5 6

Output:
Symmetric Matrix

Explanation:
The matrix is square (3 × 3) and for every i and j, element[i][j] = element[j][i].

Test Cases:

Test Case 1:
Input:
2 2
1 2
2 1
Output:
Symmetric Matrix

Test Case 2:
Input:
3 3
1 0 1
2 3 4
1 4 5
Output:
Not a Symmetric Matrix

Test Case 3:
Input:
2 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
Output:
Not a Symmetric Matrix
